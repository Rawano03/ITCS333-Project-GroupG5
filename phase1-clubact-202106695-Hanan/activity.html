          <p>The European Union has put in place a comprehensive set of legislation known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect personal data. It gives people more control over their information by regulating how businesses gather, store, and use the personal data of EU citizens. GDPR holds companies accountable for violations and emphasizes accountability, transparency, and consent. By complying with GDPR, businesses can build trust with customers, protect privacy, and ensure they meet legal obligations in a world increasingly reliant on data-driven technologies.</p>

          <p>The process of using codes and ciphers to secure data and communication is known as cryptography.
               To prevent unwanted access and guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and validity of the data, plain text is transformed into unintelligible ciphertext.
                For digital systems like cloud storage, email, and online banking to be secure, cryptography is essential. 
                It protects sensitive data from being intercepted or altered during transmission by using mathematical algorithms and key-based encryption techniques.
                Cryptography remains an essential area of study in computer science and cybersecurity, helping to protect our digital lives as technology and cyberthreats change.</p>
